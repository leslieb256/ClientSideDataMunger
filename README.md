# What is this?
An all in one, self contained html file which can load a csv file, display the contents and write the result back to your desktop.

This example will take a CSV file, display it in a table and then you can click a button to down load it again. So does the basics so you can build on it easily.

# TODO
 - read multiple files
 - read a directory of files
 - support drag and drop
